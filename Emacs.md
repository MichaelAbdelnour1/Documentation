### Configuration

Your Emacs configuration is typically stored in a file named `.emacs` or `init.el` in your `.emacs.d` directory.

- **Open the configuration file:** `C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el`
- **Add custom configurations:** Edit the file to add or change settings.

### Example Configuration

Hereâ€™s a basic example to enable line numbers and syntax highlighting:

```elisp
;; Enable line numbers
(global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

;; Enable syntax highlighting
